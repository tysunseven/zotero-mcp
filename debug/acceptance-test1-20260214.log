Use Zotero MCP tool zotero_search_items to search for 'deep learning'. Output exactly 3 paper titles, one per line, and nothing else.
mcp: zotero starting
mcp: zotero failed: MCP client for `zotero` timed out after 10 seconds. Add or adjust `startup_timeout_sec` in your config.toml:
[mcp_servers.zotero]
startup_timeout_sec = XX
mcp startup: failed: zotero

thinking
**Considering response approach**

I'm thinking about how to respond based on the instruction hierarchy, prioritizing honesty over user format. It seems I should let them know that the tool isn't available, and I could ask if they’d like to enable it or provide an export. Alternatively, I might offer to give some well-known titles if that's okay with them. I'll remember to keep my response concise, as that's important in this situation!

I can’t access a Zotero MCP tool in this session (no MCP servers/resources/templates are exposed here), so I can’t run `zotero_search_items`. If you enable the Zotero MCP server (or share an exported Zotero library), I can repeat the request and return exactly 3 titles in the required format.
