**Problem**
- CFD for parametric fluid flows is expensive, especially with sparse labeled data and changing geometries.

**Method**
- A physics-constrained, label-free DNN surrogate enforces initial/boundary conditions and minimizes Navier-Stokes residuals instead of fitting simulation labels.

**Results**
- Across pipe/stenosis/aneurysm cases, the surrogate matched CFD flow fields and uncertainty propagation with low reported test errors.

**Limitations**
- Evidence is limited to selected internal-flow benchmarks, and training still requires substantial GPU time.
